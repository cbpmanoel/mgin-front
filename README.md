## Key Features

### **Vue 3 Frontend**

- **Reactive State Management**: Uses Vueâ€™s reactivity system to manage application state, such as cart data and product information.
- **Modular Design**: Organized into views, components, and composables for maintainability and scalability.
- **Dynamic Routing**: Utilizes Vue Router for seamless navigation between views.

### **Tailwind CSS Styling**

- **Utility-First CSS**: Tailwind CSS is used for styling, ensuring a consistent and responsive design across devices.
- **Customizable Themes**: Easily extend or modify the default Tailwind configuration to match branding requirements.

### **Vite Build Tool**

- **Fast Development**: Vite provides instant server start and hot module replacement (HMR) for a smooth development experience.
- **Optimized Production Build**: Vite generates highly optimized production builds for deployment.

### **API Integration**

- **Data Fetching**: Retrieves categories, menu items, and images from the **MGin Kiosk API** using **Axios**.
- **Order Management**: Sends structured order data to the backend API for processing.
- **Error Handling**: Includes mechanisms to handle API errors, ensuring a smoother user experience.

## Application Structure

The application is organized into the following key directories and files:

- **`src/`**: Contains the core application logic, including:
    - **`views/`**: Defines the main views of the app (`ProductsView.vue`, `CartView.vue`, `PaymentView.vue`).
    - **`components/`**: Reusable UI components (e.g., `ItemCard.vue`, `SidePanel.vue`, `ModalWindow.vue`).
    - **`composables/`**: Custom hooks for managing state and logic (e.g., `useCart.js`, `useCategories.js`, `useImageLoader.js`).
    - **`assets/`**: Static assets such as images and SVG icons.
    - **`router/`**: Defines the application routes using Vue Router.
    - **`utils/`**: Utility functions for API calls, debouncing, and more.
- **`public/`**: Contains static files like the favicon.
- **`tailwind.config.js`**: Tailwind CSS configuration file.
- **`vite.config.js`**: Vite configuration file.
- **`package.json`**: Lists project dependencies and scripts.

## Views and Components

### **ProductsView**

Displays the menu items in a scrollable grid, organized by categories. Includes a sidebar for navigation and a cart summary.

### **CartView**

Shows the current cart with a list of items, quantity selectors, and a summary of the total cost.

### **PaymentView**

Provides a payment form for completing orders, including options for credit card payments.

### **Reusable Components**

- **ItemCard.vue**: Displays individual menu items with name, image, and price.
- **SidePanel.vue**: Implements collapsible navigation for categories and the cart.
- **ModalWindow.vue**: Provides a reusable modal component for actions like confirming orders or showing alerts.

## State Management

The app uses **Vue 3 Composables** to modularize and reuse state management logic. Each composable focuses on a specific concern (e.g., cart, categories, images), simplifying both development and testing.

### **useCart Composable**

Manages the cart state, including adding/removing items, updating quantities, and calculating totals. Persists the cart state in `localStorage`.

### **useCategories Composable**

Fetches and manages the list of categories from the API, ensuring data validation and retry mechanisms for failed requests.

### **useCategoryItems Composable**

Fetches and manages the list of items for a specific category, with data validation and retry mechanisms.

### **useImageLoader Composable**

Handles the loading and caching of images from the API, ensuring efficient image display and memory management.

## Environment Variables

The following environment variable is required to configure the application. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and populate it with the example below:

```env
# Development Environment
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000

# Production Environment
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://api.example.com
```
